# TaskMe
This is my TO_DO_LIST web application named TaskMe. It is made with pure HTML, CSS and JS and contains the following functionalities:
-Add tasks
-Delete tasks individually
-Clear all tasks at once
-Update (edit) tasks
-Add due date and date of adding tasks
-Mark tasks as finished or not by clicking on them
-Drag and drop tasks and give priorities to each one based on that drag and drop
-Display tasks based on filter (finished and unfinished tasks)
-Search for tasks by name (check if tasks exist or not)
